# Github Repo Starter

- Replace 'fcaramez' with your own GitHub Username
- When running the script, make sure you first create an empty Repo
- After that, create the local folder on your machine with the exact same name as the Repo
- You can always modify the file creation and delete the readme

## Warnings:

- Make sure you have the right permissions to run the script, if not, run `chmod 775 repo-starter.sh`

## Enjoy :)
