# Github Repo Starter

* Replace 'fcaramez' with your own GitHub Username
* When running the script, make sure you first create an empty Repo
* After that, create the local folder on your machine with the exact same name as the Repo
* You can always modify the file creation and delete the readme
  
Enjoy :)
